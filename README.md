<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Philosophers project, introduces US to multithreading and synchronization, 
focusing on concurrent programming concepts. The project is based on the "Dining Philosophers" problem, 
a classic example of a synchronization challenge involving processes (or threads) that share resources.

**Project Overview:**

You will simulate a group of philosophers sitting at a table, alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, but there is only one fork per philosopher, which leads to competition and potential deadlock.

**Key Objectives:**
- Multithreading: Use threads to simulate each philosopherâ€™s actions concurrently.
- Synchronization: Manage shared resources (forks) using mutexes to prevent race conditions.
- Avoiding Deadlocks: Implement strategies to avoid deadlock situations where philosophers wait indefinitely for forks.
- Time Management: Ensure that philosophers act according to precise timing rules for eating, sleeping, and thinking.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is a C program so you need to have gcc compiler.
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install gcc -y
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lyyrst/Philosophers.git
2. Makefile !
   ```sh
   make && make clean
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

use this command :
```sh
./Philo [n_philosophers] [time to die] [time to eat] [time to sleep] [optional: n_meal]
```
Example:
```sh
./Philo 4 800 200 200
```
There is 4 philosophers, they die after 800 miliseconds without eating, and they take 200 milisecond to eat or sleep.
```sh
./Philo 4 800 200 200 5
```
The simulation stop when all philosopher get 5 meals.

## Reminder

Please remember that this project is one of the first i did as a computer science learner, it does not reflect my actual skills but through which project i learned programming.
